I made Chess CMD in python to refresh my knowledge with python's data structures and algorithms.  The project isn't finished yet but I already implemented player's rook and pawn movements and I also fixed lots of errors. I included every errors I fixed and algorithms i implemented in my fb
I also included some videos in my fb, feel free to watch my works :)
