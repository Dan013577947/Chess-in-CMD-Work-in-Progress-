I made Chess CMD in python to refresh my knowledge with python's data structures and algorithms. The project isn't finished yet but I already implemented player's rook and pawn movements and I also fixed lots of errors. I included every errors I fixed in my fb
I also included some videos in my fb, feel dree to watch my works :)
